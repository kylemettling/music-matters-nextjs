## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Next.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, supabase, react-beautiful-dnd

Companion app for musicians to create & customize chord progressions of searched songs. Ingress data influences the suggested
scale of chord cards to drag and drop into track sections. Change key signatures, chord qualities/types, reorder cards on the fly. 

## Optimizations

Music Matters has moved to Next.js!!

## Lessons Learned:

This project culminated from finding myself having difficulties recalling chord progressions while improvising with guitar. 

## TODOs:


## Keep Exploring:
